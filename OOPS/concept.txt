By default the variable/attributes of the class are private. You need to use the public keyword to change them. 


INITIALIZER LIST
More efficient than making a constructor. The initializer list is just more slightly more efficient because it directly initializes members to their values, 
instead of default-initializing them and then assigning them (2 steps).

Example
Point(int i = 0, int j = 0):x(i), y(j) {}
    /*  The above use of Initializer list is optional as the
        constructor can also be written as:
        Point(int i = 0, int j = 0) {
            x = i;
            y = j;
        }
    */
