COPY CONSTRUCTOR

Shallow COPY
When the copy constructor is not defined by the user and is copied automatically

Deep COPY
When we copy the constructor by making the copy cons. i.e overriding it.

We use deep copy constructor when we have to use pointers as attributes. This is cuz when
we use pointers, and call the copy constructrs, both the objects point to the same memory 
location. Hence if now if you want to change the content of one object, it'll automatically 
affect the other objects also.
