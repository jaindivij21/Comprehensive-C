// UNIQUE PROBLEM 3
// In an array all elements appear thrice. Find the number that appears once using bitwise operators

Ex.
7 
1112223

ANS.
3

// LOGIC?
// Calculate the sum of every bit position and store in an array
// if an element is occuring thrice, the sum of bits at every position of every number will be of the form
// 3N; however it can also be 3N+1, if that position has a set bit from the number occuring once.
/*
 *  EXAMPLE:
 *  3-011
 *  3-011
 *  3-011
 *  1-001
 *  -----
 *    034 (0, 3n, 3n+1)
 *
 *  now take modulas by three to get the ans number
 *    001 = 1
