// Inclusion Exclusion Problem
// Concept of Sets

// Find the number of numbers between less than equal to N which are divisible by any of the primes below 20

// Concept

For example we need to find all the numbers less than 100 which are divisible by 2 and 3
Take 2 and 3 in a set then,

A = Nos less than 100 divisible by 2
B = Nos less than 100 divisible by 3

Total number of subsets = 3
= 2^2 - 1

Therefore,
    AUB = Nos less than 100 divisible by both 2 and 3
        = A + B - AintersectionB (3 subsets)

    // funda here is to add odd terms and subtract even terms
