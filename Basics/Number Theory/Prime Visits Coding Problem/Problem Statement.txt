PMO gives two random numbers a & b to the Prime Minister. 
PM Modi wants to visit all countries between a and b (inclusive) , 
However due to shortage of time he can't visit each and every country , 
So PM Modi decides to visit only those countries,for which country number has two divisors.
So your task is to find number of countries Mr. Modi will visit.

Input Format
The first line contains N , no of test cases. The next N lines contain two integers a and b denoting the range of country numbers.

Constraints
a<=1000000 & b<=1000000.
N<=1000

Output Format
Output contains N lines each containing an answer for the test case.

Sample Input
2
1 10
11 20
Sample Output
4
4

 Issue w this problem is that the range of test cases is alot hence we'll get TLE Error
 Example. Even if we use the most effecient method of finding prime numbers that is prime sieve,
 it still is alot of time cuz:

 to make the sieve: NloglogN == approx O(N)
 now we need to count the number of ones in a range. if a = 1 and b = 10^6 = N = b - a, the range becomes 10^6 and therefore
 total time complexity = O(1000*10^6) = O(10^9) which is huge

 So what to do?
 Find prime sieve normally in approx O(N) time.
 Now make another array and store cumulative number of primes uptil that number in O(N)
 Now in liner time which can be max O(10^6), we can find number of prime numbers between a range just by subtracting their contents in
 array.
