Logic For Finding Number of Divisors of a Number

1) Using prime sieve find all the prime factors of a Number
        60 = 2*2*3*5
        60 = 2(2) 3(1) 5(1)

2) Basic Logic to find number of divisors is the total number of combiantions these prime factors can make.
        Ex. 2*2*3 = 12 (Which is a factor of 60)
            3*5 = 15 (Which is a factor of 60)
            2*3*5 = 30 (Which is a factor of 60)
            ..... so on

3) So the total number of divisors is dependent on powers of these prime factors
        Ex.  60 = 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^1 where p1 = 2, p2 = 1 and p3 = 1
        Therefore, 
        Total Number of divisors is = (p1+1)*(p2+1)*(p3+1) = 3*2*2 = 12

        But why add 1 to each power => to consider combination where it isn't present
