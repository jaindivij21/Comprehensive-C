Regarding passing through function.

1) Array can only be passed by reference or essentially the pointers to the first element of the array are passed. Hence, in the questions of recursion and 
backtracking, we often need to reverse/backtrack what we did to the array after every call.

2) The vectors however can be passed through value or reference. Use '&' to pass by reference.
