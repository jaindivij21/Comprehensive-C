Problem:
    There is a graph of cities. You need to travel from src to destination and minimimze the cost to travel.    
    You can travel bw 2 cities through trains and flights whose respective costs are given in the question. Mind that while travelling, 
    you can take ATMOST one flight. Find and print the minimum cost path.

Solution Concpet:
    Case 1: 
        Doesn't take the flight. So compute dijikstra[src-des] using train weights.
    Case 2:
        # Let "Src --> X --> Y --> Des" is our path, where X and Y are vertices of our graph.
        # Now we apply dijikstra from Src to get shortest paths to x (which can be any of the vertex).
        # We alse appy dijikstra from des to get shortest path to y (we did this to reduce time complexity as we'll have to apply dijistra only once cuz 
          otherwise there will be so many *y'*s that may be in the optiaml path, hence we would have to apply dijistra N number of times where N is 
          number of vertices)  
        # Lastly for every x and y, calculate the min value of these 3 paths.

    ANS: min(case 1 and case 2)
