Vectors

They are nothing but dynamic arrays that is we dont need to define any size for them.
Whenever the space allocated gets over, it expands itself by *doubling* itself i.e allocated the same amount of memory more to itself jitni abhi

// Information about reading data from the user
Doubling is an expensive operation. When you ask the user for the number of elements and then run a loop to input the vector. Every time the vector's size 
doubles iself - 1,2,4,8,16.. so on. This is not recommended. So whenever you know the rough number of elements in the vector, RESERVE THE SPACE FOR IT.

eg.
*v.reserve(1000)*
now take the input.
