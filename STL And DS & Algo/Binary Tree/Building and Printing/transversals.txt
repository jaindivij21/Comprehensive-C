TRANSVERSALS

RECURSIVE:
1) PREORDER (DEPTH FIRST ORDER) 
        Root - Left - Right (Print when traversing through the left of the node)
2) INORDER 
        Left - Root - Right (Print when traversing through the bottom of the node)
3) POSTORDER (BOTTOM UP)
        Left - Right - Root (Print when traversing through the right side of the node)
4) LEVEL ORDER
        Subsequent levels are printed (makes use of height of tree)


Given inorder transversal, one of the middle element is the root, in preorder the first element while in postorder the last element is the 
root element!


ITERATIVE:
1) BFS (LEVEL ORDER)
        Uses Queue
2) DFS (PREORDER)
        Uses stack
