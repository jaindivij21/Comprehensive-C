Binary Search Tree

Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
    The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node's key. 
    The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.

The search complexity of a Binary Search Tree is O(log N)
