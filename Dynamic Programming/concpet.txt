DP Types:
1) Memorization (Top Down)
2) Pure DP (Bottom Up)

So mostly we define DP problems as :::
    1) Memorization
    2) Pure DP (Bottom Up or Top Down Approach)
The time complexity 99 percent of the times is the number of possible *STATES* in the problem.
For example in the fibonacci series question, if n = 5 then, total states possible cannot be more than 5!
So the time complexity is O(n). 

Which problems can be solved using DP:
    1) Overlapping
    2) Optimal Substructure : local best becomes global best.
